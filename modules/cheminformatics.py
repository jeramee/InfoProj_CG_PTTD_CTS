    This module provides cheminformatics analysis tools.

    Data Sources:
    - Compound libraries (e.g., ChEMBL, ZINC Database) for bioactive ALK compounds.
    - Drug-target interactions (BindingDB, DrugBank) for understanding mechanism-specific actions.
    - Pharmacokinetics (ADMETlab) for toxicity and metabolism analysis.

    Integration Strategy:
    - Cross-reference compound structures against known ALK mutations to improve therapy prediction accuracy.
